## yo-bow (Yet One more Bunyan Output Wrapper)
A Bunyan logger instance that outputs in a non-JSON format

## Motivation
Bunyan outputs in JSON format. It is great for processing the logs programmatically, but I had a hard time to read the 
logs in that format. So I wrote this wrapper function that returns a Bunyan logger instance and outputs in a more 
readable format to human. It is done as default by executing bunyan command in the child process. One of the aims is to 
have this library also run in Microsoft Windows.

## Features
Easy to get Bunyan output to an easier to read format


## Code Example
### Use the library

    const logger = yoBow.getLogger('test 1');
    let printCount = 0;
    logger.trace('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.debug('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.info('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.warn('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.error('success ' + printCount++);
    // Log Level is set to 'info' as default, so any levels below 'info' will not be displayed
```
