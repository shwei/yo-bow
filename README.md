## yo-bow (Yet One more Bunyan Output Wrapper)
A Bunyan logger instance that outputs in a non-JSON format

## Motivation
Bunyan outputs in JSON format. It is great for processing the logs programmatically, but I had a hard time to read the 
logs in that format. So I wrote this wrapper function that returns a Bunyan logger instance and outputs in a more 
readable format to human.

[Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)


## Features
- Easy to have Bunyan output to a JSON format or to regular text. 
- Also run in Microsoft Windows.


## Code Example
### Use the library
```javascript
    const yoBow = require('yo-bow');
    const logger = yoBow.getLogger('test 1');
    let printCount = 0;
    logger.trace('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.debug('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.info('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.warn('success ' + printCount++);
    logger.error('success ' + printCount++);
    // Log Level is set to 'info' as default, so any levels below 'info' will not be displayed
```
### Actual Output
```
